# Lichess-API-Performance-Tracker
Track Chess ratings over time, for any Chess variant, and see your progress through the Lichess API. 

Plots Chess ratings against date-time for user: skrajput01 in Antichess (a variant of chess). 

As an avid Antichess player, having won multiple Bronze and Silver trophies and being ranked in the top 2.6% worldwide, I hope to achieve the title of Antichess Candidate Master (ACM) by 2023. While Lichess.org provides a line graph showing my past performance, without a regression line, it can be difficult to tell how well I am doing relative to my past performance. As such, I have created this python file which tracks my performance in Antichess (but can easily be altered to measure anyone's performance in any Chess variant).
